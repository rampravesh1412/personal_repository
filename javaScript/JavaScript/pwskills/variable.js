// js variable 

// variable are mainly three types like :-


// first one let declartion variable 
let  a = 4;
let b = 5;
console.log(a+b);


let  c = "ram";
let d = "pravesh";
console.log(c+d);  //we know also as concatination



// second one is var declartion variable 
// try to avoid this declartion of variable



 var aa  = 4;
 var bb = 5;
console.log(aa+bb);


// we are re declare of  of variable in var case and ---> it is also support of hositing

  var aa = "ram";
 var bb = "pravesh";
console.log(aa+bb);  //we know also as concatination



// hositing

console.log(host);   // it is alway throw of undefined not error that why it is supporting of error;

var host = "mohan";



// cosnt is the best variable declaration , it is strict variable because we are not redeclare of single variable its have constant variable its many time using of array and object case;

// try to this variable declaration use always


const cons = "mohan" ;
const cons2 = "sohan";
console.log(cons+cons2);
